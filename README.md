### FoodieQuant

We introduce FoodieQuant, a pipeline integrating the Segment Anything Model and a ResNet50 fine-tuned on a modified version of the FoodSeg103 dataset, designed to provide accurate nutritional value estimation on the ingredient-level.

An example of the FoodieQuant estimation is available in `demo.ipynb`.
